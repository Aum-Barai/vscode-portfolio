## Environment Setup & Security

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up:

1. **Development Environment:**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local with your actual values
   # NEVER commit this file
   ```

2. **Production Environment:**
   - Set up environment variables in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
   - Never commit production credentials to the repository

### Security Guidelines

1. **Environment Files:**

   - ‚úÖ `.env.example` - Template file, safe to commit
   - ‚ùå `.env.local` - Local development, never commit
   - ‚ùå `.env.production` - Production settings, never commit
   - ‚ùå `.env.development` - Development settings, never commit

2. **API Keys:**

   - Always use environment variables for API keys
   - Rotate keys if they are ever exposed
   - Use appropriate key restrictions where possible

3. **Public Variables:**

   - Only use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for variables that are truly public
   - Never prefix sensitive values with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

4. **Version Control:**
   - Double-check `.gitignore` before committing
   - Never commit any `.env` files except `.env.example`
   - If secrets are accidentally committed, change them immediately

## Running Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All VSCode related components can be found in the `components` folder. To change the content of the portfolio, check out the `pages` folder. To add or remove pages, modify `components/Sidebar.jsx` and `components/Explorer.jsx`.
