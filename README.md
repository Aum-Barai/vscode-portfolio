# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my modern portfolio website repository. This project showcases my personal work, projects, and skills using modern web technologies.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS (if applicable)

## Project Overview

This portfolio is built using a component-based architecture for clean, maintainable, and scalable code. The project has been streamlined by removing unnecessary boilerplate and example files, such as default API routes that are not used in the final product.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.

## File Structure

- pages/ _(Main application pages)_
- components/ _(Reusable UI components)_
- public/ _(Static assets)_
- styles/ _(CSS modules)_
- Other configuration files (e.g., package.json, tsconfig.json)

## Features

- VS Code themed UI
- Responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Multiple themes:
  - GitHub Dark (default)
  - Dracula
  - Ayu
  - Nord

## Environment Setup & Security

### Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Follow these steps to set up:

1. **Development Environment:**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example env file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit .env.local with your actual values
   # NEVER commit this file
   ```

2. **Production Environment:**
   - Set up environment variables in your hosting platform (e.g., Vercel)
   - Never commit production credentials to the repository

### Security Guidelines

1. **Environment Files:**

   - ✅ `.env.example` - Template file, safe to commit
   - ❌ `.env.local` - Local development, never commit
   - ❌ `.env.production` - Production settings, never commit
   - ❌ `.env.development` - Development settings, never commit

2. **API Keys:**

   - Always use environment variables for API keys
   - Rotate keys if they are ever exposed
   - Use appropriate key restrictions where possible

3. **Public Variables:**

   - Only use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for variables that are truly public
   - Never prefix sensitive values with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

4. **Version Control:**
   - Double-check `.gitignore` before committing
   - Never commit any `.env` files except `.env.example`
   - If secrets are accidentally committed, change them immediately

## Running Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

All VSCode related components can be found in the `components` folder. To change the content of the portfolio, check out the `pages` folder. To add or remove pages, modify `components/Sidebar.jsx` and `components/Explorer.jsx`.

## Next.js Resources

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
